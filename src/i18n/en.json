        "description": "VSW is complementary to the one of the first scrappers I have ever done. Its an app that scrapes the shoes from the Vans page and displays them. The official Vans website is broken in several ways, which makes using it unpleasant.\n\nMy first idea was to make a scrapper in Puppeteer and then send updates on items to my Discord server using Discord webhooks, but it was impractical as I would have to check the items every day to keep track of them, which I dont have time for. So I have created a website where I connect to the API I created earlier and display the Vans shoes with some filters, so I can quickly check for available items every time",

Well those times arent back, but we can pretend that this is the case thank to WEB WINAMP 9999. You can use winamp anytime and anywhere, all you need is a web browser and a little bit of internet connection ðŸ˜³.\n\nDuring the development of the application, I noticed that the express on the backend actually just complicates the code of my application. The backend is very simple, its only task at the moment is to download songs using Ytdl, which is impossible on the client side.\n\nKnowing a bit about the React ecosystem, I started to look into whether there might be some interesting Next counterpart for Vue. And here came Nuxt 3, which delighted me with its simplicity, as well as the amount of facilitation it serves. So I decided to move Winamp from Express to Nuxt!",
